Aaron Lennon: Everton sign Tottenham winger on loan
Everton have signed Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon on loan until the end of the Premier League season.The 27-year-old England international has scored 30 goals in 365 games for Spurs since his 2005 switch from Leeds United.He has only made nine Premier League appearances this season, with another eight in cup competitions.Hull, Stoke and QPR all wanted Lennon on transfer deadline day too but he turned them down in favour of Everton.Lennon has won 21 caps for England, but has not represented his country since a 2-1 friendly win over Brazil in February 2013."We all know what Aaron will bring to our squad with his experience and know-how, his involvement with England in two World Cups and the landmarks he has set in the Premier League," boss Roberto Martinez told Everton's website."At 27, Aaron will be a really important asset to our squad and he will represent a real boost in terms of attacking options from now to the end of the season. His pace and trickery will fit in well at Goodison."BBC pundit Jermaine Jenas, Lennon's former Spurs team-mate, said: "Everton was the better choice than Hull for Aaron Lennon."Hull are in the relegation fight and Everton will get a lift from his signing. Aaron will get the game time he needs so it is good business for both player and club."
