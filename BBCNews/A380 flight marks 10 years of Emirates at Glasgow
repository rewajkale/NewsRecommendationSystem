A380 flight marks 10 years of Emirates at Glasgow
The world's largest passenger plane is to make a one-off flight from Glasgow as Emirates airlines marks 10 years of operations from the city.Emirates said a giant Airbus A380 would fly from Glasgow to Dubai on 10 April.It will be the first time an A380, which stands more than 24 metres tall and has a wingspan of almost 80 metres, has taken off from a Scottish airport.Amanda McMillan, from Glasgow airport, said it was a "significant milestone in our country's aviation history".The Airbus A380 usually carries 525 passengers with seats in economy, business and first class, but can carry more than 850 passengers when flying with only economy seats.Emirates UK vice president Laurie Berryman said: "As the largest A380 operator in the world, it is a historic moment to see one of our A380s take flight from Glasgow Airport for the first time."Since Emirates began operations at Glasgow Airport on 10 April 2004, it has carried 2.3 million passengers.
