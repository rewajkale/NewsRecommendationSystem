And there was no correspondence from Arsenal from Wenger or his medical team."If he's got a problem with Aaron Ramsey, pick the phone up and tell me. He called [England manager] Roy Hodgson on Theo Walcott."After the injury, Wenger said: "The fact that he played against Andorra certainly cost Gareth Bale and him [Ramsey] as well."Announcing hissquad to play Netherlands,Coleman queried why Wenger had commentated about Real Madrid's Bale."He shouldn't comment on Gareth Bale as that has nothing to do with Arsenal," he said.
