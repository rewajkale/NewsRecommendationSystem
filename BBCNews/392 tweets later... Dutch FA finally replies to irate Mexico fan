Bayern Munich winger Robben later admittedhe had dived during the game, although not for the penalty.But Mexico captain Rafael Marquez, who fouled Robben, said at the time: "I spoke with Robben after the match and he told me that it was not a penalty."Now, after more than a year of being tweeted "no era penal", the Dutch FA have responded to Josesomor26 with..."Congratulations! @Josesomor26 #itwasapenalty"Media playback is not supported on this device
