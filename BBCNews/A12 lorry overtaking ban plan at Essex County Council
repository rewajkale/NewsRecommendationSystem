A12 lorry overtaking ban plan at Essex County Council
Lorries could be banned from overtaking on the Essex stretch of the A12 if proposals are approved.Conservatives on Essex County Council claim lorries in the outside lanes are contributing to congestion.A motion for a ban on HGVs overtaking is to go before the council and, if successful, will go to the Secretary of State for Transport for approval.Hauliers say most of the vehicles they overtake are not lorries, but cars driving slower than 50mph (80km/h).The motion is expected to go before the county council on 9 July.Rodney Bass, who will propose the motion, said: "There is absolutely no doubt of the frustration felt by motorists as they frequently sit behind one lorry as it slowly attempts to overtake another one with the result of long queues building up."This is not an attack on road hauliers who provide a vital service for our county and beyond."But it is aimed at recognising that the A12 is a important road that is very congested and overtaking lorries do contribute to slow journey times and we believe that this ban would improve that situation for all."David Scott-Smith, of the Road Haulage Association, said: "It doesn't get our vote."He said an overtaking ban was likely to produce a "long queue of trucks" preventing other motorists from joining the A12 from slip roads.
