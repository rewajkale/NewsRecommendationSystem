Abandoned micro-pig gets a new home on Gower
An abandoned little porker is happy as a pig in muck after being given a new home on Gower.The micro-pig,found in a garden in Ystalyfera,Neath Port Talbot, is now at his new home at Gower Fresh Christmas Trees in Three Crosses.The RSPCA thought he was lonely as he kept trying to break into a sheep pen where he was being temporarily housed.The unnamed piglet had 26 offers and has doubled in size in two weeks as he settles in at his new home.
