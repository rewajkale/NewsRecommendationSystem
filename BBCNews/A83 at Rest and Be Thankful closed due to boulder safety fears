A83 at Rest and Be Thankful closed due to boulder safety fears
The A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll has been closed overnight due to safety concerns following a landslide on the road last week.The route had reopened after the landslip during Storm Frank but was closed again on Monday following a geotechnical assessment.Operators said they were worried a large boulder above the route may fall.The preferred Old Military Road diversion was also closed, with an alternative diversion via Dalmally.About 200-300 tonnes of debris crashed on to the road during Storm Frank last Wednesday.A spokeswoman for road operators Bear Scotland said: "During a geotechnical assessment today at the site on the Rest and be Thankful which was subject to the landslip on the 30 December 2015, a 150T boulder some 175m above the A83 has been identified as being at risk of mobilising."Following this assessment a decision has been taken to close the A83 overnight in the interest of safety. This same risk currently applies to the preferred Old Military Road diversion route."Bear Scotland said drivers would be able to travel in a controlled convoy on the Old Military Road from 09:00 on Tuesday.The boulder was due to be removed using explosives, with the work expected to take about two days.
