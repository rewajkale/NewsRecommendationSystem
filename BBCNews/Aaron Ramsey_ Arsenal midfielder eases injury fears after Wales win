Aaron Ramsey: Arsenal midfielder eases injury fears after Wales win
Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey hopes to be fit for the Gunners' Premier League clash against Manchester City on Saturday.The 23-year-old injured his ankle inWales' 2-1 Euro 2016 qualification win in Andorra.He picked up the injury in the Estadio Nacional after twisting on the controversial artificial pitch."I'll be alright - the pitch was very hard. There's no give in it so I rolled my ankle a bit," said Ramsey."Hopefully it will be nothing and I'll be available for Saturday. These are the games you want to play in and I'm looking forward to it."Wales needed Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale to score twice, including a late free-kick, to prevent an embarrassing start to their Euro 2016 qualifying group, which also includes Belgium, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Cyprus and Israel.The artificial surface in Andorra was heavilycriticised by Baleand manager Chris Coleman after the game.Coleman said: "The pitch is not up to the standard of a Uefa qualifier. But I don't want to make a protest because I want other teams to come here."I didn't want to say anything about the pitch before the game, but I can now and if you're a passing team forget it."Ramsey added: "I don't know how you could play football on that pitch to be honest."Normally we play quick and play the ball on the floor, playing around teams, but we couldn't do that."It was bobbly so it was very difficult. The main thing is we came here and won. Now we can move on and play on grass next time."Wales' next Group B qualifier is at home against Bosnia, who lost 2-1 at home to Cyprus, on Friday 10 October.
